# Orchard Cluster Deployment Guide

Orchard cluster consists of two components: Orchard Controller and a pool of Orchard Workers. Orchard Controller is
responsible for managing the cluster and scheduling of resources. Orchard Workers are responsible for executing the VMs.

The following guide is split in two parts. First, we'll [deploy an Orchard Controller](#deploying-orchard-controller) and then we'll
[configure and register Orchard Workers](#configuring-orchard-workers) with Ansible.

## Deploying Orchard Controller

Orchard API is secured by default: all requests must be authenticated with credentials of a service account.
When you first run Orchard Controller, you can specify `ORCHARD_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_TOKEN` which will automatically
create a service account named `bootstrap-admin` with all privileges. Let's first generate `ORCHARD_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_TOKEN`:

```bash
export ORCHARD_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

Now you can run Orchard Controller on a server of your choice. In the following sections you'll find several examples of
how to run Orchard Controller in various environments. Feel free to submit PRs with more examples.

### Google Cloud Compute Engine

An example below will deploy a single instance of Orchard Controller in Google Cloud Compute Engine in `us-central1` region.

First, let's create a static IP address for our instance

```bash
gcloud compute addresses create orchard-ip --region=us-central1
export ORCHARD_IP=$(gcloud compute addresses describe orchard-ip --format='value(address)' --region=us-central1)
```

Once we have the IP address, we can create a new instance with Orchard Controller running inside a container:

```bash
gcloud compute instances create-with-container orchard-controller \
  --machine-type=e2-micro \
  --zone=us-central1-a \
  --image-family cos-stable \
  --image-project cos-cloud \
  --tags=https-server \
  --address=$ORCHARD_IP \
  --container-image=ghcr.io/cirruslabs/orchard:latest \
  --container-env=PORT=443 \
  --container-env=ORCHARD_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_TOKEN=$ORCHARD_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_TOKEN \
  --container-mount-host-path=host-path=/home/orchard-data,mode=rw,mount-path=/data
```

Now you can create a new context for your local client:

```bash
orchard context create --name production \
  --service-account-name bootstrap-admin \
  --service-account-token $ORCHARD_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_TOKEN \
  https://$ORCHARD_IP:443
```

And select it as the default context:

```bash
orchard context default production
```

## Configuring Orchard Workers

```bash
orchard create service-account worker-pool-m1 --roles "compute:read" --roles "compute:write"
orchard get bootstrap-token worker-pool-m1
```

## Configuring Orchard Workers

If you have a set of machines that you want to use as Orchard Workers, you can use Ansible to configure them.
Please refer a [separate repository](https://github.com/cirruslabs/ansible-orchard) where we prepared a basic
Ansible playbook for convenient setup.
